        {/* Introduction */}
        <p>
          The airline industry is a dominant sector of the global economy, with a current market size of over 500 billion dollars and a projected valuation of over 635 billion dollars by 2030 (1). Within this ever-growing pie, there are many well-known airlines that people know and love, including United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Delta Airlines. However, no conversation regarding the airline industry is complete without mentioning American Airlines, the commanding air service responsible for transporting more passengers than any other in the United States. The aviation giant recently posted a revenue of over 44 billion dollars and carried over 95 million passengers in its 858 mainline aircraft units, an astonishing figure that trounced its competitors (2). Put simply, there are few companies that embody the size and scope of the airline industry more than American Airlines.
        </p>

          American Airlines traces its roots to 1926 when the world-famous pilot Charles Lindbergh flew from St. Louis to Chicago to deliver mail for Robertson Aircraft Corporation. This flight would mark the first of many for the aerial transport company. Over the next decade, Robertson Aircraft Corporation combined with several other aviation firms, developed an integrated routing system, and rebranded itself as American Airlines, Inc. In 1939, the New York Stock Exchange listed American for the first time. From that period onward, American Airlines would establish itself as an innovative and economic force in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first of many innovations by American Airlines was the creation of the airport lounge in 1940. This idea revolutionized the flying experience for customers and fostered the widely held perception that flying is a luxury. The enduring influence of this change is evident by the fact that most of today's airports still have these very types of lounges. Then, in 1944, American Airlines became the world's first scheduled air cargo service. This change made transporting commercial goods and packages much more convenient for businesses and other entities. In 1957, the air carrier developed the American Airlines Stewardess College. This facility was home to the first specialized training programs for flight attendants. Less than a decade later, American hired David Harris, the first African American commercial airline pilot (3). These innovations helped American Airlines solidify its position as one of the foremost aviation powers in the United States.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-900">Performance in Past Wars:</h2>
        <p>
          This analysis examines American Airlines' stock performance during major military conflicts throughout history. The analysis of American Airlines' stock prices during the Second World War is relatively difficult, considering the airline first went public just three months before Germany invaded Poland and initiated the deadliest military conflict the world has ever seen. Since analysts did not have access to public stock price data before the war began, it is challenging to determine how the stock price reacted. Nonetheless, there are still some worthwhile assumptions people can draw from examining the stock price during the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          First and foremost, in the six years that the war took place, the beta of American Airlines was .78. This figure demonstrates that the stock prices of American Airlines were less volatile than the general S&P 500. This may initially surprise some people, considering commercial travel declined significantly because of the war. However, many airlines had a crucial role in the war by transporting materials and people during mobilization efforts. American Airlines was not different as it helped move American troops to Brazil after Pearl Harbor and flew supplies across the North Atlantic. The then-president of American Airlines, Maj. C.R Smith, even served as an executive officer for the Air Transport Committee and helped develop flight schedules for the army (4). Therefore, while demand for commercial travel declined, the demand for air cargo transportation and supply shipments rose. This effect meant that American Airlines' stock remained relatively stable compared to other companies. Investors should notice this dichotomy because it demonstrates that American Airlines' air cargo operations are somewhat of a natural hedge during outbreaks of war. In other words, when commercial travel declines, supply and cargo shipments rise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story of American Airlines stock prices during the Korean War is very different from the erratic fluctuations and oscillations that investors witnessed during the Second World War. The stock prices of the aviation company were practically identical from month to month during the war. The stock's beta of .21 during the war further cements the notion that American Airlines was far less volatile and unpredictable than other firms in the early 1950s.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a couple of possible explanations for why stock prices barely budged in the wake of the Korean War. First, the war was considerably shorter than the Second World War, meaning the stock price had less time to change dramatically. The war's relatively short duration also meant that the conflict strained fewer resources, and the military was less dependent on commercial airlines for cargo transportation. The more obvious reason, however, is that American Airlines was a predominately domestic airline at this point. The carrier company did not expand internationally until the 1970s when it ventured into Europe, South America, and the Pacific. Therefore, the outbreak of the Korean War barely impacted American Airlines and its domestic operations. Secondly, commercial travel was practically nonexistent in Korea at this point. For reference, the first passenger flight in South Korea was in 1948, just two years before the Korean War began (5). In simpler terms, American Airlines experienced minimal effects from the Korean War, and this truth is evident in its consistent stock price.
        </p>
        <p>
          The largest American air travel service may have eluded the Korean War unscathed, but the period during the Vietnam War was a different story. The late 1950s were quite like the early 1950s, an era defined by minor price fluctuations and overall consistency for American Airlines stockholders. The 1960s, however, painted a completely different picture as the price rapidly rose to a zenith of over 93 dollars in April 1967 before dramatically falling in less than a month. The reason for this dramatic price reduction was the 1967 War in the Middle East, where multiple Middle Eastern nations, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq, banded together, and banned oil shipments to the United States and some of its closest allies. Furthermore, the closure of the Suez Canal devastated trade and shipping routes and further exacerbated rising oil costs. These international events demonstrate that even domestic airlines are not immune to foreign conflicts. The beta of American stock was 1.364 during this period, suggesting that it was even more volatile than other stocks in the S&P 500. Investors should carefully examine these events and understand that oil prices and Middle East instability can both devastate returns on American Airlines' equity.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-900">Conclusion and Investment Advice:</h2>
        <p>
          The age-old question regarding this financial analysis is how investors should react and modify their investment strategies based on the information, particularly regarding the latest international conflict stemming from Eastern Europe. In other words, should Americans buy more airline stocks while the Russo-Ukrainian war rages on? Should they sell the stocks if they have any? The answer to these questions is complex and will vary based on how one perceives the Russo-Ukrainian war to continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Investor Thomas Niel believes the American Airlines stock will continue to underperform because of rising fuel and labor costs. He believes these steep oil and gas prices will continue because of existing sanctions on Russia (6). The contributor mentions that demand has been waning for the airline for a while now and sees no signs of said decline stopping soon. This interpretation is supported by the aviation operator's performance during both the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. When global tensions arise and fuel costs spike, airlines across the board struggle to post promising financial figures, which negatively affects their stock performance. American Airlines is certainly no exception to this rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Investor Joel Baglole, meanwhile, believes that the worst days of the Russo-Ukrainian Wars are in the past and that American Airlines stock will rebound in the coming months. He mentions how crude oil prices are slowly dropping and believes that airlines will fix rising labor costs by passing the expense onto consumers through higher fees (7). He likewise believes that the holiday season will introduce some much-needed demand resurgence for American Airlines and its competitors. This point of view is partially supported by the stock's performance during the Korean War as the Russo-Ukrainian war is not being fought on American soil. Therefore, if demand remains in the United States, American Airlines should be able to succeed despite some international turmoil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both sides make compelling arguments. In general, investors should approach purchasing American Airlines stock with caution given the volatility of the Russo-Ukrainian War. If the war worsens and more sanctions are levied, it is possible that fuel costs will rise even more, crippling American Airlines in the process. However, if the war stays relatively dormant over the next few months, American Airlines can survive off domestic demand and a looming holiday season. There is no perfect answer to the question given how much uncertainty there is, but investors should maintain some airline exposure just in case things do get better. After all, diversification is never the worst advice.
