       {/* Introduction */}
       <p>
         One of my favorite aspects of investing, and often one of its most underappreciated components, is dividend payouts. Though seldom substantial, dividends can provide a steady stream of payments in a world of equity investing where consistency and predictability are too scarce. Furthermore, according to Merril Lynch, companies that frequently increase their dividends are often higher-quality and offer a buffer against market downturns.[1] A long story short - chasing dividends pays off - until the payouts stop. Eastman Kodak investors learned this truth in 2009 when the global imaging company, once heralded as a dividend titan with yields hovering around 7% in the early 2000s, cut its payouts altogether. This article will examine some of the highest dividend yields in the United States and assess whether these alluring rates are hidden gems or simply fool's gold.

         <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-900">1. Franklin BSP Realty Trust (FBRT)</h2>
         <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
           <p class="font-semibold">Trailing Dividend & Yield: $1.42 (10.97%)</p>
           <p class="font-semibold">Stock Price (as of 2/12): $12.95</p>
           <p class="font-semibold">Industry: Real Estate Investment Trust â€“ Mortgage</p>
         </div>
         <p>
           Franklin BSP Realty Trust is a commercial real estate investment firm that issues first mortgage loans ranging from $10 to 250 million on diverse US property types to generate stable income for shareholders. The real estate trust is featured prominently in the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF, with the BlackRock-owned fund possessing roughly 7% of the total shares. According to MarketBeat, the trust has a "Buy" rating with a consensus price target of $15.50.[2] However, it is worth noting that only six analysts have given their opinion on the fledgling small-cap company.
         </p>
         <p>
           In the first nine months of 2024, the dividend payout ratio for the trust reached an eye-popping 131.5% ($1.065 DPS / $.81 EPS), suggesting looming sustainability concerns and limiting potential for future dividend growth. For comparison, the dividend payout ratio for the fiscal year 2023 was 100% ($1.42 DPS/ $1.42 EPS), reflecting the REIT's practice of distributing all its earnings to shareholders. In 2023, the FCF per share was $1.98, notably exceeding the $1.42 dividends per share. This juxtaposition suggests that the free cash flows comfortably cover its dividends, painting a rosier outlook than the dividend payout ratio. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $.36, which it has maintained since increasing its dividend from $.07 in 2021.
         </p>
         <p>
           There are a few worthwhile considerations to make before choosing to invest in Franklin BSP Realty Trust. One upside is the firm's steadfast commitment to paying dividends, even during economic strife. Even when the firm posted a sizable net loss from capital restructuring and debt repayments in 2022, the owners still dispensed what little they had back to shareholders. The nature of the business, with zero capital expenditures, also indicates that the firm is unlikely to plow its earnings back into the business. The main downside, however, is the firm's lack of a proven track record, having only paid a large dividend for four years. The occasional net losses, brief history of consistent dividends, and small-cap nature of the business suggest the enticing yield may be a trap. In my view, investors are better off looking elsewhere, especially given the lack of dividend growth.

       <div class="space-y-4">
         <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-900">2. Altria Group, Inc. (MO)</h2>
         <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
           <p class="font-semibold">Trailing Dividend & Yield: $4.00 (7.43%)</p>
           <p class="font-semibold">Stock Price (as of 2/12): $53.34</p>
           <p class="font-semibold">Industry: Tobacco</p>
         </div>
         <p>
           Altria Group Inc., one of the more contentious companies on the New York Stock Exchange, is the leading U.S. manufacturer of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, boasting a portfolio that includes Marlboro and U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company. The tobacco behemoth was once part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average but lost its membership in 2008 due to declining sales and consumer sentiment toward tobacco. It remains a member of the S&P 500. According to MarketBeat, Altria Group is a mixed bag, with a consensus price target of $53.29.[3] Most analysts recommend that investors hold rather than purchase shares.
         </p>
         <p>
           Given that Altria Group originated nearly two centuries ago, it is a well-established and predictable entity in the realm of investing. This principle is especially apparent in the enterprise's income statement, which exemplifies a steady revenue of roughly $20 billion each of the past six years. The company's dividend coverage ratio of 1.49 suggests minimal problems apportioning its income to shareholders, though it may not reach the loftier levels some investors may prefer. The company's declining price-earnings ratio of 8.83 (below market average) shows tepid expectations of future growth, which limits the true ceiling the dividends can reach in the coming years. However, the positive news is that Altria has steadily increased its dividend by an average of 18 cents each year over the past decade. In September, the cigarette producer hiked its dividend by four cents per quarter. The bottom line is while revenue has been stable, dividends have steadily increased over the last ten years.
         </p>
         <p>
           How investor's view Altria predominately depends on their individual preferences and risk tolerance. Investors seeking skyrocketing Nvidia-esque market returns will certainly leave disappointed, but those looking for a steady stream of dividends with 4% annual dividend growth will find confidence in Altria. The mounting legal pressures of vape markets may throw a wrench in things, but a cigarette producer in the United States is certainly no stranger to courtroom chaos. From my perspective, dividend investors should seize the opportunity to purchase Altria Group shares whenever possible.

         <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-900">3. Pangaea Logistics Solutions, Ltd. (PANL)</h2>
         <div class="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
           <p class="font-semibold">Trailing Dividend & Yield: $.40 (7.65%)</p>
           <p class="font-semibold">Stock Price (as of 2/12): $5.13</p>
           <p class="font-semibold">Industry: Marine Shipping</p>
         </div>
         <p>
           Pangaea Logistics Solutions is a small-value marine shipping company that specializes in transporting dry bulk cargo of raw materials to top businesses. The firm collects profits from shipping contracts, one-off voyage charters, and renting out cargo ships. The firm, founded in 1996, is currently listed on the NASDAQ. Concerningly, the stock price has nosedived over 40% in the past year, a stark contrast to the lifetime high of $9.20 roughly a year ago.
         </p>
         <p>
           The trailing dividend yield of 7.65% is captivating, but some concerning foundations underpin the company's 10-k. The company's massive outflows for investing activities, coupled with the ratio of capital expenditures as % of sales nearly doubling to 11%, indicates increasing capital intensity and less room for dividend growth. Furthermore, the enterprise's free cash flow has decreased dramatically over the past three years, posing sustainability concerns for a stable dividend. Their remarkably high dividend payout ratio of 83.3% may be attractive to some investors, but it is far from a guarantee that these payments will continue. For reference, Pangaea Logistics Solutions did not even pay a dividend before 2019. Investors lured in by the current dividend may be content in the short term, but they could quickly lose confidence in a stock that is rapidly losing value.
         </p>
         <p>
           Unlike some of the other stocks we covered, the decision regarding Pangaea Logistics seems clear and resolute. Pangaea may right the ship, literally and figuratively, and investors who buy the dip over the past year may be handsomely rewarded. However, from a strictly dividend standpoint, there are safer alternatives with longer track records and more predictable results. Dividend aristocrats and Dow Jones mainstays offer more stability, making them a better choice for investors seeking steady growth.
