        <p>
          It is still bright and early in 2025, but one trend seems to startle many investors: the Magnificent 7 no longer appears so magnificent. Both Apple and Amazon have shown infinitesimal growth over the first two months of the year. The emergence of the lean and effective Deepseek in the AI space has, for the first time in years, made Nvidia appear human. Microsoft's stock has decreased by over 2% since January, whereas Tesla has crashed from suboptimal revenue figures and a dismal earnings report. Many investors are shifting to rising stars like Palantir and are wondering whether these technological titans have reached the apex of their dominance in the year 2024. One exception, however, notably bucks this trend: Mark Zuckerberg's brainchild—the company that inspired The Social Network—Meta Platforms. The high-tech conglomerate, whose lineup includes FaceBook, WhatsApp, and cutting-edge VR technology, has posted a record-breaking 17-day trading streak - the longest in its history - and shows no signs of stopping soon. In this article, I will outline why investors are bullish on the social media behemoth and assess whether its growth signals lasting momentum or is merely an ephemeral facade investors should avoid.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meta shares are currently trading at roughly $737, a 22.93% increase from the beginning of the year. For reference, an investor who purchased 100 shares of the stock on January 1st would have already made over $13,740 in capital gains. It is safe to say that anyone with considerable exposure to Meta has been ecstatic with the start of the year. Still, the question persists: should investors who weren't as fortunate hop on the bandwagon now, or is the record-breaking rally nearing its conclusion? And for those who own shares, is it time to jump ship before things take a turn for the worse? To answer these questions, one should examine some crucial underlying fundamentals in the firm's financial statements.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-900">Segment Results:</h2>
        <p>
          The firm's total revenue increased to $164.50 billion in 2024, a 22% increase from 2023. The segmented financial statement reveals that over 98% of its revenue came from its Family of Apps (FoA) segment, which includes the popular social networks for which the company is best known, such as Facebook and Instagram. The operating margin of the FoA increased by 7%, the revenue increased by 22%, and the expenses only increased by 7%. Notably, the daily active people (people who visit one of Meta's apps on a given day) was 3.35 billion, an annual increase of 5% or over 160 million since December 2023. Furthermore, ad impressions increased by 11% and the average price per advertisement increased by 10% since 2023. In simpler terms, more people are using the app, those who use it are spending more time on it, and advertisers are paying a premium to reach these users and encourage them to buy their products. This is a lethal combination, and with Meta holding second place globally in digital advertising, it's a strong indicator of the company's core operations and prospects.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the flip side, the Reality Labs segment is quite a bit less promising, a fact the company openly acknowledges in its notes to financial statement users. The segment, which includes the company's virtual and mixed reality offerings, reported nearly an $18 billion loss and only a 13% increase in revenue. Its expenses amount to roughly 21% of total costs, but the revenue barely scratched 1% of the enterprise's sales. The business overview notes this segment will continue to operate at a loss for the coming years but firmly believes it will be transformative for the Internet landscape in the long term. The jury is still out on this, but I have reservations about consumer sentiment toward VR wearables, especially considering the failure of Google Glass in the early 2010s. Will the public ever truly embrace smart technology in their eyeglasses? Will ordinary people ever stop chuckling at the perceived absurdity of Meta Quest's virtual reality headsets? The firm recently aired a Super Bowl ad highlighting its Meta AI glasses, and with its partnership with luxury eyeglasses maker Ray-Ban, alongside fashion icons like Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner, I could see consumers gradually adopting the technology. However, as of right now, this is all speculative as the RL segment of Meta has yet to prove itself as a meaningful contributor to the conglomerate's revenue.

          Meta's balance sheet unveils a new set of insights into the firm's operations and presents a promising outlook on the firms near future. The company's current ratio increased from 2.67 to 3, indicating healthier coverage of short-term liabilities and reduced liquidity concerns. The increase in current assets is headlined by Meta's acquisition of over $10 billion in more marketable securities, indicating further growth prospects and shrewd money management. On the liabilities side of the balance sheet, Meta did acquire over $10 billion in long-term debt, signaling its bullish growth strategies and investments in generative AI and technical infrastructure. Notably, the notes also include that Meta plans to invest roughly $60-65 billion in 2025 to support core business operations, particularly artificial intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
          While worrisome to some, the increased capital expenditures are further confirmation of Meta's recent operating prowess and demonstrate that the company is doing what it needs to remain at the forefront of growth and development. The company's strong retained earnings—over $20 billion in growth in 2024—along with a stable cash position ($2 billion in growth), suggest that the dominance of Meta's Family of Apps (FoA) gives it the resources it needs to capitalize on upcoming growth opportunities, including data centers and budding technological infrastructure. Moreover, the company's equity ratio of 66% further reaffirms a healthy financial position and relatively low reliance on debt to finance its operations. In other words, Meta's balance sheet exemplifies the kind of financial strength that would make it highly appealing to investors irrespective of any additional debt.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-900">Notes in Financial Statement:</h2>
        <p>
          The quantitative figures in the financial statements are what flashes across CNBC and Bloomberg chyrons and serve as key reference points for investors seeking quick insights into the firm's prospects. However, the qualitative notes to the financial statements are equally, if not more, important than the statements themselves as they provide context into the firm's direction, expectations, and potential hurdles. In specific, Meta outlines a series of risk factors it anticipates facing soon. The interpretation of these possibilities and their likelihood are critical in assessing Meta's stock price moving forward. Below, I will spotlight several of these concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
          One central risk Meta identifies regarding its product offerings is decreased retention or user engagement from competitive sources, such as TikTok, or changing geopolitical or macroeconomic conditions, such as restrictions in Russia in the wake of the Russo-Ukrainian War. Furthermore, the firm details how its products could suffer if new features are ill-received, the quality of its content deteriorates, or third-party apps make it difficult for consumers to install their apps. Evaluating the validity of these concerns is largely speculative and requires connecting dots that have yet to be drawn. However, the company's recent abandonment of fact-checkers and adoption of more lenient content moderation could have implications. Will users view the policies as accommodating their freedom of speech, or will advertisers and existing consumers balk if more harmful content is introduced to the platform? Considering most of Meta's revenue comes from advertising, any reduction in marketing will have long-standing ramifications for the business. In my view, the policies will likely curry favor with the new presidential administration and its supporters, potentially helping the company in future litigation from the federal government. However, I could also see younger, progressive users searching for alternatives if the impact of these changes becomes evident, particularly if harmful content becomes more prevalent. Time will tell, but the company's recent surge in daily active users suggests this will not be a dramatic problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          The company's recent entry into generative AI also brings substantial risks and legal concerns. As Meta describes, the world of generative AI introduces the possibility of harmful or illegal content, bias, discrimination, deepfakes, copyright infringement, and cybersecurity concerns. Furthermore, the legal framework for AI is still evolving, so governments and regulatory agencies may impose restrictions, as seen by the EU AI Act. There is also the possibility that Meta's generative AI may not be as successful as other companies. We have already seen DeepSeek hurt Nvidia's stock performance when reports emerged that the Chinese large language model was more efficient. What if the artificial intelligence developed by Meta fails, or a competitor like TikTok capitalizes off the technology in a much better way? While these points are valid, there are a few arguments in Meta's favor worth considering. First, Meta already invested $40 billion into its AI models this past year and expects an additional $60-65 billion in 2025. The Llama 3 model has already shown rapid developments in high-quality code generation, improved response creation, and multilingual functionality. The massive capital expenditures indicate that Meta will introduce better models shortly. It also creates unimaginable barriers to entry for competitor firms who do not have access to the capital needed for computing power or gargantuan data centers. Second, the concerns regarding the ethical usage of AI are very real, but I also believe Meta is one of the few companies well-equipped to handle these pressures. With existing networks of legal counsel and regulatory oversight, along with boatloads of cash and lobbying influence, Meta has the infrastructure required to weather these concerns better than startups or less established firms. In short, while other firms may be weighed down by legal fees, Meta has the financial and human capital to navigate these costs and comply with any regulations governments may impose in the coming years. All in all, while AI presents considerable risks, Meta's strong financial position allows it to mitigate these challenges more effectively than most firms.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-900">The Final Verdict:</h2>
        <p>
          It is always challenging to recommend a stock that has already experienced a 642.94% increase over the past two and a half years, along with a record-breaking 17 consecutive days of growth. It calls to mind the well-worn adage, "If it seems too good to be true, it probably is." If I were to tell you to purchase the stock based solely on its recent performance, I believe my advice would be ill-advisable and superficial. Furthermore, I do believe a market correction is in order, considering how unprecedented this surge is. However, the company's underlying fundamentals point to this being a worthy stock for most investors with a long time horizon. The consistent revenue growth, stable cash position, and a significant increase in operating margin highlight how Meta is performing better than ever before. The rise in capital expenditures, along with planned headcount reductions and the potential acquisition of FuriosaAI, demonstrate that Meta is optimizing resources while staying at the forefront of growth and innovation. The current P/E ratio of 29.93 is lower than Meta's historical average of 33.63, suggesting a blend of healthy optimism regarding the company's growth potential, while possibly indicating further underestimation of its value. Furthermore, the sheer size of Meta's daily average user base and the length of user engagement with its products make it difficult to bet against the high-tech conglomerate. There is some uncertainty surrounding generative AI, changes to content moderation, and the reliability of its Reality Segment. However, the dominance of Meta's core apps provides a level of security that few other companies can match, and none of these concerns have seemed to matter to investors yet. In short, while I expect a bit less promising trajectory over the coming months, I do believe that Meta Platforms is a buy with lasting momentum for years to come.
